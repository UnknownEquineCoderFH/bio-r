# Hello goulash, here's notes for the both of us, please contribute

## Notes for Bertoldo

- [x] Clean up data by removing the "A", "M" and "P" values (and the duplicate columns alongside them)
- [x] Then repeat this process but ignore the numbers this time
- [ ] Expand on the architecture, talk about activation functions, loss functions, optimizers, etc.
- [x] Look into NLP architectures, like VGG16 and VGG19 (mind you, you don't have to implement them correctly, I can fix them later)

## Notes for me
